### Contact Information

Contact me via mail `josipbegic57@gmail.com` for any additional information.

### Future Work

I am planing on adding Chat-bot for analysing stock data and prediction, along with that subscription plans should be functional.
With those features application should be transferred from monolith to microservice architecture using message queues like RabbitMQ.

Application is currently deployed on free tier of Netlify and Render service.
